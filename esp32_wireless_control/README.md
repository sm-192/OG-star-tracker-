# OG Star Tracker : Wireless Control Hardware (Rev 2.0)

This simple PCB and firmware intends to make it easier to control the OG Star Tracker. If you have any suggestions/ideas about new features or would like to contribute, post in the OG star tracker [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/dyFKm79gKJ) or message me (Discord: jahh#8924).
If you like this work, feel free to connect with me on [Github](https://github.com/jugal2001) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jugaljesing/).
### Features:
- Wirelessly Control the tracker from your phone/laptop by connecting to a webpage
- Supports AP (Access Point) and STA (Station) mode
 -- AP  : The ESP32 will create a wifi network which you can connect to
 -- STA : The ESP32 connects to an existing wifi network specified by you, Ex: phone hotspot. (Not fully tested)
- Integrated intervalometer which can control your camera shutter, no need to buy extra hardware. Exposures can be controlled via the webpage
  - Intervalometer Modes:
    - Long Exposure Still: Classic astro mode with tracking to get long exposures on the same target. Optional dithering.
    - Long Exposure Movie: Long exposures with tracking and dither plus at the end of a set of exposures the axis is rewound (a frame) and the next set started. This give the ability to create a movie          of the night sky moving over a terrestrial object when couple with a video making software.
    -  Day Time Lapse: Standard time lapse with exposure settings controlled by the camera.
    -  Day Time Lapse with Pan: Standard time lapse with exposure settings controlled by the camera plus a pan of X degrees in between every exposure.
- Presets : Up to 10 preset intervalometer settings can be saved for retrieval next session.
- USB port to power a Dew Heater
- Slewing supported at different speeds.

## Building guide

One can get the full kit from the the official store at [ogstartech.com](https://ogstartech.com/start) or can build the tracker itself based on the instructions given at [printables](https://www.printables.com/model/348574-og-star-tracker)

## Firmware

The firmware for the PCB is provided in this repository and can be compiled and flashed with the given [instructions](docs/compiling.md).
To control the PCB the tracker will create its own wifi access point with the following default credentials:

```
ssid: OG Star Tracker
password: password123
```

After connection was successful the tracker to actually control it access the **tracker.local** in your browser. The ESP32 provides a webserver for convenient controlling.

If one would like to set it own wifi config, check [Wifi Config](docs/wifi_config.md).

## App

If the webserver is not enough there is a app available to improve the accessibility even further.
Check out https://github.com/OndraGejdos/OG-star-tracker-App for more details.
